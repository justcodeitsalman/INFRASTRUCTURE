Dynamodb  (Documnet type or Key Value pair )
==============================================================================
Dynamodb is service of unstructured database which is managed by AWS.

1.>>what is sturcture of dynamodb documnet ?

<<Table>>  #collection of data items
  <<item>> #group pf attribute that is uniquely identifiable among all of the other items.
      << attributes>> # key value pair
      
A table cosisiste of item as beloo
item 1:
roll-no:1
name: salman
calss : btech
age: 25

item 2:
roll-no:2
name: saklen
branch: BA
fav color: black

Note: need to define one primary key

2.what is the aggregate size of amazon dynamodb one item?
>> it cannnot excide 400kb 

3.what is the way if have to store the data more then 400kb size in item ?
>> you need to store that data in Amazon s3 and provide the url to one of attribute of item.

4.no fo table can be created for one accout ?
>> 256 tables can be created per account 
=================================================
Dynamodb- Read capacity unit
a.strongly consistent read  # get you upto date data whcih includes recently commited data as well #latency is observed
b.eventually consistent read # get you data faster but can't give garranty to provide recent commited data 
1 RCU = can read 4kb of data

formula to calculate RCU:
RCU = (item_size / 4 KB) * read_throughput
25= (100/4)*1
RCU =total_data/4kb
max 10,000 RCU

>>1 RCU repesent one strongly consistent read per second and 2 eventually consistent read per sec

for Write capacity unit 
WCU = (item_size / 1 KB) * write_throughput
 50 =100/1*1
max 10,000 WCU


 
 ==================================================
 Dynamo DB pricing 
 
 you pay for 
 
 Provisioned Capacity:
 DynamoDB offers provisioned capacity mode where you specify the desired Read Capacity Units (RCUs) 
 and Write Capacity Units (WCUs) to meet your application's performance requirements.
 You pay for the provisioned capacity regardless of the actual usage. The pricing for provisioned capacity 
 includes hourly rates based on the number of RCUs and WCUs provisioned.
 
Storage: You are charged for the amount of data stored in DynamoDB,
including the primary key, attributes, and any secondary indexes. 
The pricing for storage is based on the average size of your data over a month, calculated in gigabytes (GB).

Data Transfer: DynamoDB charges for data transfer both in and out of the service. 
This includes data transfer within the same AWS region, data transfer between different AWS regions, and data transfer to the internet.

Additional Features: DynamoDB offers additional features such as Global Tables (for multi-region replication),
On-Demand Capacity mode (pay per request without specifying provisioned capacity), 
and DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for caching. 
These features have their own pricing models, so you should review the AWS pricing documentation for specific details.
